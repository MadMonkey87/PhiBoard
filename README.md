# PhiBoard
E-Ink based remote &amp; dashboard for your smart home

# Introduction

PhiBoard is a smart home remote & dashboard for the M5Stack Paper. It allows you to create custom dashboards to display various data on the e-ink display or controll your smart home.

Important note: PhiBoard does not intend to controll devices directly nor does it implement any brand specific features. Instead it is intended to be integrated in smart home systems (Homey, Home Assistant,...). To do so PhiBoard provides an open api and documentation but again does not implement anything specific as it should be usable for a wide variety of usage scenarios.

# How it works

A PhiBoard dashboard is defined by a json file that describes the widgets. There are several properties that are shared by all widgets (type, size % appId) and some that depend on the type (i.e current value, type,...).
The purpose of a widget is to display a value and or trigger an action. It is also possible that a widget displays multiple values or can trigger different action.
